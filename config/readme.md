# Configuration Variables

## readingorder

- `simple`: Media entries are considered separate, discrete entities, with no overarching chronology. Leaf nodes will display navigation arrows to neighboring leaves with lower and higher chronology values. As such, chronology values can be repeated outside of sibling sets.
- `chronology`: Media entries are considered parts of a whole. Chronology values *cannot* be repeated, anywhere.

## wordcount

- `true`: Word counts will be displayed on link cards and media pages.
- `false`: Word counts will *not* be displayed on link cards or media pages.

## publicationdate

- `true`: Publication dates will be displayed on link cards and media pages.
- `false`: Publication dates will *not* be displayed on link cards or media pages.
