# Configuration Variables

## wordCount

- `true`: Word counts will be displayed on link cards and media pages.
- `false`: Word counts will *not* be displayed on link cards or media pages.

## publicationDate

- `true`: Publication dates will be displayed on link cards and media pages.
- `false`: Publication dates will *not* be displayed on link cards or media pages.

## rootName

String of adminâ€™s choosing. Determines the display text of the backlink on root nodes ("Table of Contents" by default).

## referenceEnabled

- `true`: Reference links will be generated on media pages, and a link to the reference homepage will be displayed in the main menu.
- `false`: Reference links will be *not* generated on media pages, and a link to the reference homepage will *not* be displayed in the main menu.
