![Wall of History: The Complete BIONICLE Legend](/img/ogp2.png)

[Wall of History](https://wallofhistory.com/) is a web archive of the entire BIONICLE legend — compiled into an accessible, easy-to-read format. For those of you who might not be aware, BIONICLE was a LEGO theme that ran from 2001 to 2010, with a lengthy original story told through animations, comics, guidebooks, movies, novels, podcasts, short stories, story serials, and even the flavor text on some trading cards. Because this story was told through so many different mediums, it’s pretty difficult (even for hardcore fans) to figure out what is and isn’t worth reading or watching, as well as what order to read and watch everything in — Wall of History was created to solve this problem.

To learn about how Wall of History came to be, I’d recommend reading [“The History of Wall of History”](https://www.maskofdestiny.com/news/the-history-of-wall-of-history/), an article I wrote for Mask of Destiny (which Wall of History is a part of). I’d also recommend checking out the [Wall of History Compilation Philosophy](https://pastebin.com/xiCuM9kb) on my Pastebin.

Wall of History couldn’t be what it is today without the help of my Chronicler’s Company, consisting of [@Jalaguy](https://twitter.com/Jalaguy) and [@TheWadapan](https://twitter.com/TheWadapan), as well as everyone at [the BioMedia Project](http://biomediaproject.com/bmp/). The lovely art seen above was drawn for us by [@M1STERRYAN](https://twitter.com/M1STERRYAN).
